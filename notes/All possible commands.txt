All dates need to be in the format of DDMMYY. E.g. 290418 means "Apr 29th 2018". Year is assumed to be 20XX, where XX is anything from 00 - 99;
// Should I create a feature to prevent recording of any future entries / entries yet to happen. example if it is 290418 now, you cannot write entry as 300418.

// Allow user to pipeline or combine commands? such as "view log all & view sum all"

view log all
view log X	--> where X is a date
view log date 200418 to date 290418

view sum all	--> means view summary
view sum X	--> where X is a date
view sum date 200418 to date 290418


edit log



All entries/logs have UIDs, where the UID is DATE_"Transaction ID of the day"
e.g. 290418_12 means the 12th Transaction of Apr 29th 2018.
The Transaction ID will be automatically updated when a new transaction/entry/log is inserted
